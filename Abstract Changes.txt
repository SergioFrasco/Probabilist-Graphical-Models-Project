Needs to be half as long

be more specific with the rl, mention the specific community and be a voice to that community.. talk about how hierarchical RL emerging as a tool rather than just RL.

reference the proposed work dont reference research directly. Last half would go into an intro. more specific.. maybe no generalization.
hierarchical rol -> Grid cell representation -> then maybe some generalization out of it.

"However, the question of whether introducing hierarchical
structure into SR models can further enhance their adaptability and gen-
eralization capabilities remains largely unexplored."

this is one of the many proposals i make in the abstract... choose one and stick with it.
keep it specific to one research question. in case there is no time to do all of them

reference planned results
